# Open Relay Flow 🌊🎙️
Open Relay Flow is a CPaaS (Communications Platform as a Service) designed to empower developers, startups, and enterprises to build next-generation voice assistants over VoIP. Integrating artificial intelligence with Asterisk-based infrastructure, it enables the creation of intelligent, multi-tenant conversation flows that respond naturally and scale effortlessly.

*"Conversational AI for all."*

🛠️ **How to Get Started**  
⚠️ *Open Relay Flow is not a plug-and-play application.*  

It’s a platform composed of microservices, SIP/media infrastructure (e.g., Asterisk, RTPEngine), and cloud integrations (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, ElevenLabs). Deployment requires assembling components based on your architecture.  

**Steps to Begin**:  
1. **Understand the Architecture**:  
   Open Relay Flow uses microservices communicating over HTTP, gRPC, SIP, and WebRTC. You’ll need:  
   - A Kubernetes environment (e.g., GCP GKE or AWS EKS)  
   - A public domain with TLS (e.g., via Cloudflare)  
   - Compute instances with static public IPs  
   - Media path (RTPEngine or equivalent)  
   - Asterisk for call bridging, conferencing, and SIP registration  
   - Laravel for multi-tenant backend management  
   Read the [architecture guide](https://docs.openrelayflow.com/architecture) (coming soon) for details.  

2. **Set Up the Platform**:  
   - Clone the [open-relay](https://github.com/openrelayflow/relay-app) repository.  
   - Follow the [quick-start guide](https://docs.openrelayflow.com/quickstart) for deployment instructions.  

3. **Test with Example Flows**:  
   - Explore the [example-flows](https://github.com/openrelayflow/example-flows) repository to deploy pre-built IVRs or bots.
